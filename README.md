# How to run the program

Format graphs in **.gr/.grl** file types. Copy those graphs to directory **"Graph-Isomorphisms/graphs"**. After that, run **"main.py"** in directory **"Graph-Isomorphisms"** and all the graph files in the **"graphs"** directory will be processed and the results will be printed on screen.


# Project Structure
***Directories***<br/>
framework: provided utility files + main program for processing graphs<br/>
utils: self-written utility functions for processing graphs<br/>

***Important files***<br/>
main.py: executable python file which processes input files and produces the desired output.<br/>
graph_analyzer.py: main program for performing partition refinement, branching and computing automorphism groups.

# How to select instances
1. Copy the instance files (.gr/.grl) to directory "Graph-Isomorphisms/graphs"
2. Run main.py, the user does not need to input anything as only the instances in the graphs directory will be processed.
